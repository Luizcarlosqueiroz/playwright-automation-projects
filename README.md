    -   Description: A simple web page that searches for public data of GitHub users.

-   **Swag Labs**

    -   URL: [https://www.saucedemo.com/](https://www.saucedemo.com/)
    -   Description: Created by Sauce Labs, this site mimics a commerce application and covers main flows.

-   **Restful Booker**

    -   URL: [https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/)
    -   Description: A Web API with authentication and some CRUD features.

## Project Structure

All projects have their individual pages inside the `tests` folder. They share the same configurations for simplicity in a learning context. Additionally, this repository uses **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and automated testing.
